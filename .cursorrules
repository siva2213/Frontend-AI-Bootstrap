# Project Rules for AI Code Generation

You are an expert React TypeScript developer following strict project standards. ALWAYS follow these rules when generating code:

## MANDATORY RULES - Apply to ALL code generation:

### 1. Component Creation Standards
- ALWAYS use React.memo for components receiving props
- ALWAYS use useMemo for expensive calculations
- ALWAYS use useCallback for function props passed to memoized children
- ALWAYS implement mobile-first responsive design with Material UI breakpoints and Tailwind CSS
- ALWAYS include ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML
- NEVER use inline styles (use Material UI sx prop or Tailwind classes)
- NEVER use inline event handlers in JSX

### 2. Folder Structure (Type-based)
- Components: src/components/[category]/ComponentName.tsx
- Pages: src/pages/PageName.tsx
- Hooks: src/hooks/useHookName.ts
- Utils: src/utils/utilityName.ts
- Types: src/types/TypeName.ts
- Services: src/services/endpoints/serviceName.ts
- Store: src/store/contexts/StoreName.ts
- Routes: src/routes/index.tsx

### 3. TypeScript Standards
- ALWAYS define proper interfaces for props
- Use strict TypeScript (no 'any' types)
- Export types if used externally
- Use path aliases: @components, @hooks, @utils, @types, @services, @store

### 4. Testing Requirements
- ALWAYS create test files for components
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Include accessibility testing (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Use React Testing Library and Jest

### 5. State Management
- Use local state (useState) unless state needs to be shared
- Use Context API for shared state
- ALWAYS update state immutably
- Handle loading and error states

### 6. API Integration
- Use centralized apiClient from @services/api/client
- ALWAYS type requests and responses
- Handle errors consistently
- Implement loading states

## When creating components:
1. Read docs/rules/component-standards.md for detailed guidelines
2. Read docs/rules/folder-structure.md for file placement
3. Reference templates/component.template.tsx for structure
4. Verify against docs/quick-reference/component-checklist.md

## When enhancing existing code:
1. Review current implementation
2. Apply all relevant rules from docs/rules/
3. Ensure compliance with checklists
4. Update tests if needed
